<!-- Why Use a CDN in HTML?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used in HTML to load external libraries, scripts, stylesheets, and assets efficiently. Instead of hosting these files on your server, you use a CDN URL to fetch them from globally distributed servers.

Benefits of Using a CDN
✅ 1. Faster Load Times
CDNs have multiple servers worldwide, ensuring files are delivered from the nearest location, reducing latency.
✅ 2. Reduced Server Load
Since the assets are served from a CDN, your web server handles fewer requests, improving performance.
✅ 3. Caching and Improved Performance
Browsers cache CDN files, meaning users don’t have to download the same file multiple times if they visit different sites using the same CDN.
✅ 4. Automatic Updates
You always get the latest stable version of the library (if using versioned URLs like latest).
✅ 5. Improved Reliability
If your server goes down, CDN-hosted files remain accessible.
✅ 6. Security Enhancements
Reputable CDNs provide security features like DDoS protection and SSL/TLS encryption. -->



<!-- In React (or any web application), Cross-Origin refers to situations where a web application running on one domain
  (origin) tries to request resources (like APIs, images, or fonts) from a different domain. This is controlled by the 
  Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). -->


    //this is react dom how can create html code or create element in html
    React.createElement("div",{id:"container1"},[

    const containerDiv = React.createElement('div',{id:"container"},  //first you need select root node
        React.createElement('h1',{className:"h1"},"hey this is react h1"),
        React.createElement('h2',{className:"h1"},"hey this is react h2")
    ]),
    React.createElement("div",{id:"container2"},[

    ])
)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); //this where you need to render
root.render(containerDiv);
